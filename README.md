# Sandwich - The Culinary Masterpiece

Sandwiches are a science mixed with art, crafted with delicate precision, yet remain a complex mystery. The following article is many years of sleepless nights, weeks extending into weekends, and missed holidays, all done in order a greater purpose in understanding.

## History

Origins of creation by man are unknown. Nature, however, has created many objects that fit within perfect form and consistency of the sandwich.

## Categories

Of course, a sandwich is not complete without an 'outside'. Size, shape, coverage, and other metrics are what determine the type of sandwich.

Many properties are debatable, many sandwiches fit into more than one category, and many can transition given heat, time, or other variables. Multiple states can be combined into a larger, more complete sandwich.

### Coverage

* 0° - serving platform / coverage ingredient in parallel with ingredients and/or garnishes. Notable examples are open-faced sandwiches, pizza, and cracker stacks. Technically, a toast sandwich is also 0°.
* opposing-sides - "traditional" sandwich, easiest to recognize, even to the casual observer. Notable examples are Reuben, fluffer-nutter, and the all-american cheeseburger.
* 270° - ingredients nearly encompassed, leaving a small portion to "breathe". Notable examples are gyros, hot-dogs, and tacos. Pizza slices may transition to 270° upon stylized consumption.
* full - entirely contained ingredients. Notable examples are burritos, egg rolls, and hot pockets. A garnished burrito is a combination of "full" and "0°" in that the burrito is the aforementioned serving platform.
* [removed] none - serving platform is a non-edible container or dish, full of ingredients. Notable examples are salsa, soup, and dip.

Experimental topics, such as soup, may be covered in an additional sub-heading, due to the complexity.

## Experimental

A delicate spectrum exists between solid ingredients and liquid ingredients that has confused many throughout time. The ratio of solid to liquid can change a meal from salad, to salsa, and ultimately to soup.

```
Salad             Equilibrium              Soup
|                     |                     |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
```

Examples :

* Ordering too much salad dressing on a salad can be considered a soup, if the ratio of liquid (dressing) to solid (grasses) exceeds the equilibrium threshold.
* Breakfast cereal is a soup. Depending on the type of cereal, as time passes there is a quicker transition from soup to equilibrium. Rice Krispies are the quickest to transition, Grape Nuts are slowest (as of current studies).
* A bowl of ketchup is a soup. Some people deceptively call it tomato soup, especially when paired with a grilled cheese (sandwich of category "opposing sides" with a solid milk-product inner ingredient).
* As aptly named, "potato salad" is a salad. As is any collection of solid ingredients without a liquid. A bowl of potato chips is also potato salad.
